Together with my colleagues Folgert Karsdorp, Adina Nerghes, and Marieke van Erp, we recently bundled our strength and set in motion plans to form a community focusing on computational methods to answer humanities questions. 

 Despite the growing use of computational methods in humanities research by an increasingly wide variety of scholars, many interdisciplinary scholars (including ourselves) still feel that there is no suitable research-oriented venue to present and/or publish robust, computational work that does not lose sight of questions relevant to the humanities. As such, we aim to fill this niche by creating a community for computational humanities researchers.

Ultimately, the goal of the computational humanities community is to set up a research-oriented computational humanities journal and conference. In the coming months, we will announce a workshop that is open to (short and long) full paper submissions. This workshop will serve as a stepping stone to a new, open-access journal of Computational Humanities Research.
