abstract: "The recent upsurge of large-scale analysis of visual material (Computer Vision) shifts the focus in Digital Humanities research away from texts. However, this has also led researchers to approach text and images as disjointed entities. We analyze similarity and change in both textual and visual elements of car advertisements extracted from digitized newspapers. By juxtaposing change over time in text and visual material, we aspire to show that the meaning of imagetexts can be studied by looking at the relation between the two forms of representation."
